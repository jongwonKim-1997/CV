Hi, I'm jongwon kim, Ph.D student of Pohang university of Science and Technology (POSTECH). I have interest for any probablistic modeling (Gaussian process, Bayesian modeling) 
and some application (Constrained Bayesian optimization, Anomaly detection, noise filtering, etc.). I collaborate projects with Samsung electronics, SK Hynix, POSCO, KETI, etc.
There are so many interesting and fascenating research topics in the world. but  Previously, I studied various industrial management engineering problems and machine learning, but recently I have been studying a lot of topics focusing on problem related quality & statistics & reliability.
